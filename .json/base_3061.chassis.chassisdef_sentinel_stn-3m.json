  "Details": "The Sentinel is a medium BattleMech built by Defiance Industries, originally under exclusive contract for the Lyran Commonwealth, as an infantry support and installation defense 'Mech. While initially pleased to have a then Terran Hegemony controlled factory manufacturing the 'Mech exclusively for the LCAF, the Lyrans were less so when a Star League Council amendment in 2652 permitted the Star League Defense Force to purchase a highly advanced version of the design which Houses Steiner, Marik and Davion would not receive until years later. The Sentinel was one of many designs to suffer from the technological decline of the Succession Wars era, with Defiance first losing the ability to manufacture its advanced weapon systems before discontinuing production entirely in 3014 due to lack of both parts and interest. Rather than disappear from the battlefield, the Sentinel now began to appear in increasing numbers thanks to ComStar and its massive stockpile of SLDF material, both providing the design to the Draconis Combine prior to the War of 3039 and using it to help outfit its Com Guards.",
