After the annihilation of Clan Wolverine, Clan Snow Raven revisited these prototypes and was able to begin mass-production of the 'Mech in 2830 and introduced 2842. They ensured that it kept up with advances in Clan technology, eventually becoming the design that is now known as the Clint IIC. Developed during the Jihad in 3073, the Clint IIC 2 was fitted with an all-energy weapons configuration. The 'Mech mounts five Medium Pulse Lasers divided amongst its center torso, left torso, and right arm; one in each of the torso locations, and the remaining three in the arm. This variant has been provided eight Improved Jump Jets to greatly enhance its mobility in tactical situations. To cope with the new levels of heat, ten Double Heat Sinks are used instead of the single versions. Additionally, an ECM Suite has been allocated to the head.
