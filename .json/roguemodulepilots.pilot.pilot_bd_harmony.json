  "Details": "Born on Solaris VII, Chris 'Harmony' Johnson was an aspiring Mechwarrior as well as a match commentator. Getting his start in the more niche arenas that were not officially sanctioned by the Solaris VII board, Harmony grew in popularity among the crowds in the brutal sport of mech combat both as a fighter and as a commentator. \r\n\r\nHowever, once he had gotten enough experience to make it to the big leagues, his dreams were crushed when he was told that 'thereâ€™s only enough room for one snarky sarcastic mech jock in the business' by his agent. Disillusioned with the glimmer and glam of life in the city of gladiators, Harmony struck out into the Inner Sphere determined to find the best match of all on a real battlefield.",
