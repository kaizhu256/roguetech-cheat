Prototype_ElectronicWarfare,Upgrade,8000000,Gear_Sensor_Prototype_ECM,6,,,,,,,,,,,This prototype electronic warfare component recreates the capabilities of the LosTech Guardian ECM. Friendly units within its ECM field gain Missile Defense and receive a +4 bonus against missiles plus immunity to Indirect Fire. Friendly units within an ECM field are effectively cloaked and cannot be targeted. This component cannot be mounted along with the Active Probe component.

Prototype_ElectronicWarfare,Upgrade,2000000,Gear_Sensor_Prototype_EWE,7.5,,,,,,,,,,,Prototype Electronic Warfare component. Adds an ECM field that provides a passive defense against missiles and immunity to indirect fire. Friendly units in the ECM field also gain Stealth Charges and cannot be targeted by direct fire unless spotted by enemy units within the ECM field or sensor locked. The ECM carrier gains an additional Stealth Charge.  The EW Suite also adds the Active Probe ability to unit's weapons panel. Active Probe is a triggered ability that uses the firing action and performs a Sensor Lock against all enemies within range. Note: you can only equip one Prototype component on most 'Mechs.
